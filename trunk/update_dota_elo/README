ent-usefulscripts/update_dota_elo aggregates DotA statistics.

Specifically, the following information will be maintained for each player (name-realm pair):
 * ELO score
 * total DotA games played here
 * wins
 * losses
 * kills
 * deaths
 * creep kills
 * creep denies
 * assists
 * neutral kills
 * tower kills
 * rax kills
 * courier kills

These can then be retrieved efficiently.

It is recommended to set this up as a cronjob every five minutes:
	*/5 * * * * /path/to/update_dota_elo/update_dota_elo /path/to/update_dota_elo/update_dota_elo.cfg > /dev/null
