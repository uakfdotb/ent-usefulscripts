ent-usefulscripts/update_w3mmd_elo aggregates W3MMD statistics.

Specifically, the following information will be maintained for each player (name-realm-category pair):
 * ELO score
 * total [category] games played here
 * wins
 * losses

Other statistics (such as kills and deaths) can be maintained by modifying the source code.
Examples for tree tag, battleships, and elite snipers are shown.

Note: the map must implement W3MMD.
	additionally, W3MMD statistics must be saved (map_type = w3mmd, map_statsw3mmdcategory = [category])

Using this, statistics can then be retrieved efficiently.

It is recommended to set this up as a cronjob every five minutes:
	*/5 * * * * /path/to/update_w3mmd_elo/update_w3mmd_elo /path/to/update_w3mmd_elo/update_w3mmd_elo.cfg > /dev/null
